# hayday-auto-farmer
Personal hayday automatic wheat harvester, collector, and seller. This will only work on my machine.

To prepare the farm, align the crates by the in-game market with the left edge of the screen, then move the screen down a bit, so that when you press on the top left-most cropfield, the game will auto-align the height. This will prevent the game from centering itself when the bot clicks on that same top left-most field.

The only available release has been marked as a `pre-release` because the only farm that has been currently configured is `ChryslerChris3`.
